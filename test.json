We are able to talk about these characteristics\\nbecause we can technically evaluate models for their performance in these areas. what many people working inside and outside of AI don’t fully appreciate is how\\ndifficult it is to build robust and reliable model evaluations. Many of today’s\\nexisting evaluation suites are limited in their ability to serve as accurate\\nindicators of model capabilities or safety.\\nAt Anthropic, we spend a lot of time building evaluations to better understand our AI\\nsystems. We also use evaluations to improve our safety as an organization, as\\nillustrated by our Responsible Scaling Policy. In doing so, we have grown to\\nappreciate some of the ways in which developing and running evaluations can be\\nchallenging.\\n\\nAssistant:\",\"max_tokens_to_sample\":2048,\"temperature\":0.5,\"top_k\":250,\"top_p\":1,\"stop_sequences\":[\"\\n\\nHuman:\"],\"anthropic_version\":\"bedrock-2023-05-31\"}"
